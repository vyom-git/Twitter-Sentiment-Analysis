# twitter-sentiment-analysis

The project was done as part of my BTech final semester project submission. The code essentially looks up user requested keywords on twitter using the twitter API and performs an analysis that gives an indication of what the sentiment around the topic is.

The code looked up 1000 tweets for 'UEFA Champions League', performed sentiment analysis on it using a positive and negative english lexicon file by comparing the tweets at a word level to assign a sentiment score (the greater the score, the more positive the sentiment, and vice versa). Along with that, there is also a word cloud output that showed the top things that people are talking about.
